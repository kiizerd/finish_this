# Finish This

A web-app to manage and help finish projects.  
I built this project to learn more about Rails  
and so that I would have simple tool that I enjoy using  
to manage my coding and other personal projects without using paper.

## Roadmap

 - make tasks, sections and projects easily completeable
 - track progress of tasks etc in a User profile model
 - add tippy JS tooltip library; add ellipses to _task partial with buttons for edit/delete inside tooltip
 - add minimodal JS modal library; replace forms with separate views with modals
 - improve UX
 - add controller and views for info pages; welcome, about, contact, etc.
 - make navbar and sidebar mobile toggles work
 - add stimulusJS and stimulus tailwind stuff
 - add bold font
 - reorganize views to not reuse so many containers, esp the various forms

## Built with
